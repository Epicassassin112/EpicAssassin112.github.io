Python blog 6

Today i finished the last question of Functions which i actually struggled with but then i got there and understood it. I have moved onto a part called 'Taking a vacation' where so far i have been defining functions and using a lot of ifs, elifs and returns. I think this part is quite easy and that is a good thing because that means i understand it fully and that means i can go on to use this in whatever is to come because functions are very important and will definitely help.
