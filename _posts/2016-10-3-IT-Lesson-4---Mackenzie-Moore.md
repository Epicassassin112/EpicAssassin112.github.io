  <tr>
    <td>I was trying different things than what the book told you to do to see if it would work my way or not so I used trial and error. For the blog I used what I already knew into making a new one and it worked and might be better than the last blog.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think having to make the new blog took some time away from me being able to do more coding to understand stuff but then also it made me understand some more about the blog I exchanged time from learning code into learning more about my blog.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
