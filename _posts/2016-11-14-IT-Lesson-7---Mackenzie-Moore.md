    <td>To do more work and to complete the electronic components project.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>We did do more work and have done more work than anyone else in the group but we sadly did not complete the electronic components project.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned by copying the code from the book and taking a bit of time to try and understand it. The strategies that were effective was looking at the code and trying to understand it because if i understand it i will be able to use it in future coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that limited my learning was at the Electrical components project which was hard to set up because you had to put the wires in the right slots which we had to try and do from a picture in the book. (which quite frankly, i think isn't clear enough) It took us quite a long time and did not succeed with it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will ask for help and then we will be able to get past that point and do more of the work to come, which will probably be exciting because i saw some robotic arms in a box. Hopefully that will take less time to setup.</td>
