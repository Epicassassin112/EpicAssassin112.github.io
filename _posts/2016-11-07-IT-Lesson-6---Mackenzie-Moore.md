  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned well because I had already done the stuff and was going through it all again so it was repetitive learning. In this way the work I did made me understand it more and got it stuck in my head. Because I have now caught up it means that we worked very well so we might even get ahead of the others considering we completed a lot.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that we were behind the others so we got less done, otherwise me and josh would have been way ahead of them if we had our use at the start. Fortunately we have caught up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will try and be more productive, even though I worked VERY hard. But I will do as much work as I did before and be ahead of the others.</td>
