I wanted to try and put a picture in my blog and started with copy and pasting a picture which didn't work when it came to publishing the post. So i went onto W3S (w3schools) and found instructions on how to make a picture and it was like this: 

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Moraine_Lake_17092005.jpg" alt="*A picture of mountains which isnt loading*" style="width:800;height:*550*;">

As you can see it is a picture.

Next i'm going to make the background an image

If you were interested, the coding for the picture is:

<img src="url” alt=”some text” style=”width:number of pixels;height:number of pixels;”>
