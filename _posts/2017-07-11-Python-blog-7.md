Python blog 7

Today i started on the 4th question of the 'Taking a vacation' lesson and i came upon a few tricky bits within it but i managed to figure it out with a lot of trial and error. It was where you had to work out the cost to rent a car and with the discounts. Here is the code for it:

def rental_car_cost(days):

    cost = days*40

    if days >= 7:

        return cost -50

    elif days >= 3:

        return cost -20

    else:

        return cost

Towards the end of the lesson it got quite hard but after some tries i managed to get it. Now it's moving onto Lists!
