Python blog 5

Today i found that someone had been working on my code academy because i hadn't logged out of my account. Other than that i have been working on functions and arguments.A function is where you set a piece of code to a word/letter if you want to repeat a piece of code with a different value rather than rewriting another who load of code. Some aspects of it are quite confusing but i got the hang of it. This part of the python coding will be very helpful when it comes to writing something by myself. I got up to the 'reviewâ€™ section, question 17.
