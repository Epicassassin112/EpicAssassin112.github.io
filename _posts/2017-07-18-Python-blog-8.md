Python blog 8

 

Today i progressed a lot with lists as i completed more than 6 exercises which i think is quite good considering i started the whole list thing last lesson and only did a couple of them. Here is the code for one of my exercises (maintaining order):

animals = ["aardvark", "badger", "duck", "emu", "fennec fox"]

duck_index = animals.index("duck") 

animals.insert(duck_index, "cobra")

print animals 

This one took me quite some time as i couldn't figure out what i was supposed to put in the 'animals.insert(duck_index, "cobra")â€™ part. Nevertheless i completed it and many others. That is all for this day!
