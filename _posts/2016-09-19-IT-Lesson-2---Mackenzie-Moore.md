    <td>To be able to customise some code using what I know.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I used the code that I remembered and made things on the fuze box such as I made a picture by repeating dots.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I used the book to help me learn the different pieces of code and to know what they did, how to use it and in what order to use it in. I also used trial and error again as it is a very good way of learning things. I kept going over the code in my head to understand what it does and what to type if I'm going to use it again.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was just trying to get through the booklet most of the time and did not stop to make sure I understood what I was typing. I should have stopped, checked and tried my own bits of code so that I knew what I was doing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will go through one stage at a time in the booklet and keep stopping so that I know what I am doing otherwise I will just be typing things down not knowing what they mean or do. When it comes to making my own code and showing someone it I won't know what to do if I don't understand what I am doing.</td>
