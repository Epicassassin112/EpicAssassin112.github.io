    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To understand how the Fuze code works.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I have so far almost reached my target because i understand how most basic parts of it work. Such as Print: which is where it displays a string or variable, CLS: which clears what is already displayed.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned by trial and error by typing in the code and if something was wrong then i would then try something else. And I would try different things on their own and see what that piece of code would do so I could later on make my own piece of code. I would use the book to do the work and know what to do and the book would tell you what order the put these pieces of code in.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I kept misspelling words and having to go back and delete it every time and I would sometimes not include a space if there was supposed to be one. This would limit my learning because I would not be able to get through as much work than I could have done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to not rush and to spell everything right the first time so I can get through more than I did before. I will also look through more of the book and learn about different pieces of code which I could also use later on if we make our own code. Also I would know how to code things when I'm finished with this topic and I can try and code on my laptop and know what to do and what to write.</td>
