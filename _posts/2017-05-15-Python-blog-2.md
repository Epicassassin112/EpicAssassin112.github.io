Title	Continuing Python on codecademy	Date	3.10.16Starting point:	We had to carry on with are Python workTarget for this lesson?	To do 1 taskDid I reach my target? (add details to "Lesson Review")	Yes I did.Lesson ReviewHow did I learn? What strategies were effective?The strategies I used to make lots of progress on python was to remember what I had already previously done and use that to complete the task. This was very helpful as if I forgot how to do something I would take a lot longer on task.What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?I need to work on thinking about the task more than just putting the first thing I think of and jumping to conclusions. This was very annoying when I forgot how to make a variable, I was stuck in it for ages until I found the answer.What will I change for next time? How will I improveNext time I will try to remember things from previous tasks so I can use them to do the harder tasks. This will help me complete Python quicker. I will also think about the task more so I don't make as many mistakes and therefore do them even quicker than if I did the first thing I thought of.
