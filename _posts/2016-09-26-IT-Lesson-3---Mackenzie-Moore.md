(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I tried to use simple pictures to draw and then I planned to make more complicated pictures but when I was making my simple pictures it was more difficult than I thought because all of the 0s and 1s had to be in the right place. I also used trial and error again.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that I did not know what order that certain piece of code in so it did not work. Also I kept trying it again and again until I made an 'alright' picture but because I tried for so long I did not get through as much work as I could have done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will practice what I want to learn but at the same time I want to learn other things to add to my ‘vocabulary’ in coding. So I will devote some time in the lesson to trying to understand something but after I will get on with some other work. I it takes to long to understand then I will just get on with other work and carry on practicing in the next lesson.</td>
